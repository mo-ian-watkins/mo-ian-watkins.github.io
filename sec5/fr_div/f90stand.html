<b>1.0 Introduction</b><p>
<b></b>The aim of this document is to provide a framework for the use of
Fortran 90 in European meteorological organizations and thereby to facilitate
the exchange of code between these centres. In order to achieve this goal we
set standards for the documentation of code, both internal and external to the
software itself, as well as setting standards for writing the code.  The latter
standards are designed to improve code readability and maintainability as well
as to ensure, as far as possible,  its portability and the efficient use of
computer resources. <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>2.0 Documentation</b><p>
<b></b>Documentation may be split into two categories: external documentation,
outside the code; and internal documentation, inside the code. These are
described in sections 2.1 and 2.2 respectively. In order for the documentation
to be useful it needs to be both up to date and readable at centres other than
that at which the code was originally produced. Since these other centres may
wish or need to modify the imported code we specify that all documentation,
both internal and external, must be available in English. <p>
<p>
<b>2.1 External Documentation </b><p>
<b></b>In most cases this will be provided at the package level, rather than
for each individual routine. It must include the following:<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>a) Top Level Scientific documentation: this sets out the problem being
solved by the package and the scientific rationale for the solution method
adopted. This documentation should be independent of (i.e. not refer to) the
code itself.<p>
<p>
b) Implementation documentation: this documents a particular implementation of
the solution method described in the scientific documentation. All routines
(subroutines, functions, modules etc...) in the package should be listed by
name together with a brief description of what they do. A calling tree for
routines within the package must be included.<p>
<p>
c) A User Guide: this describes in detail all inputs into the package. This
includes both subroutine arguments to the package and any switches or
'tuneable' variables within the package. Where appropriate default values;
sensible value ranges; etc should be given. Any files or namelists read should
be described in detail.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>2.2 Internal Documentation </b><p>
<b></b>This is to be applied at the individual routine level. There are four
types of internal documentation, all of which must be present.<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
a) Procedure headers: every  subroutine, function, module etc must have a
header. The purpose of the header is to describe the function of the routine,
probably by referring to external documentation, and to document the variables
used within the routine. All variables used within a routine must be declared
in the header  and commented as to their purpose. It is a requirement of this
standard that the headers listed in Appendix A be used and completed fully.
Centres are allowed to add extra sections to these headers if they so wish. <p>
<p>
b) Section comment: these  divide the code into numbered logical sections and
may refer to the external documentation. These comments must be placed on their
own lines at the start of the section they are defining. The recommended format
for section coments is: <p>
<p>
!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>
! &lt;Section number&gt; &lt;Section title&gt;<p>
!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>
<p>
where the text in &lt;&gt; is to be replaced appropriately.<p>
<p>
c) Other comments: these are aimed at a programmer reading the code and are
intended to simplify the task of understanding what is going on. These comments
must be placed either immediately before or on the same line as the code they
are commenting. The recommended format for these coments is:<p>
<p>
! &lt;Comment&gt;<p>
<p>
where the text in &lt;&gt; is to be replaced appropriately.<p>
<p>
d) Meaningful names: code is much more readable if meaningful words are used to
construct variable &amp; subprogram names. <p>
<p>
It is recommended that all internal documentation be written in English.
However, it is recognised that this may not always be possible, so alternative
rules for native language comments with duplicate English comments are
provided.<p>
<p>
i) Meaningful names may be written in native language.<p>
<p>
ii) Comments of type b) above written in native language must be duplicated in
English.<p>
<p>
iii) Comments of type c) above written in native language should preferably be
duplicated in English.<p>
<p>
iv) Description and method sections of the header written in native language
must be duplicated in English.<p>
<p>
v) Comments describing the declared variables in the header section may be
written in native language. A duplicate declaration with an English language
comment  should be placed in a separate file (containing all such duplicate
declarations for the package). Since repeated use of the same variable name for
different purposes with a given package is forbidden, a simple tool can be
provided to replace the native language declarations with English language
declarations in the source files of ported code.<p>

<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>3.0 Coding Rules For Packages</b><p>
<b></b>These rules are loosely based on the "plug compatibility" rules of
Kalnay et al. (1989). Rules which appear elsewhere in this document have not
been duplicated in this section.<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>3.1</b> A package shall refer only to its own modules and
subprograms and to those intrinsic  routines included in the Fortran 90
standard.<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><i>There may well be a need to extend this to include named (in this
document) libraries such as the NAG library. We could even have a joint Met.
utilities library which could contain things such as multigrid p.d.e. solvers
or routines to calculate saturated vapour pressure...</i><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>3.2</b>  A package shall provide separate set up and running
procedures, each with a single entry point. All initialization of static data
must be done in the set up procedure and this data must not be altered by the
running procedure. <i>A posix shell unix script may be used to e.g. create the
NAMELIST of section 4.4. This would allow the passing of environment variables
to the package as Fortran variables.</i><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>3.3</b> Internally the package may use MODULEs - for example the
set up and running procedures may communicate in this way.<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>3.4</b> External communication with the package must either be via
the argument lists of the entry and set up routines or via a NAMELIST file read
by the set up routine.<i> We could also allow the use of standard modules, to
be defined in  this document, containing information on the grid type and
resolution etc... The package may need to open other files. To be portable this
would have to be done in a machine independent way.</i><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>3.5</b> Interface blocks must be provided for the set up and
running procedures (possibly via module(s)). This allows the use of assumed
shape arrays, optional arguments, etc as well as allowing the compiler to check
that the actual and dummy arguments types match. If variables in these external
argument lists are of derived type, a module must be supplied which contains
the  type definition statements required to make these derived types available
to the routine calling the package.<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>3.6</b> The package shall not terminate program execution. If any
error occurs within the package it should gracefully exit, externally reporting
the error via an integer variable in its argument list (+ve = fatal error).
Packages should also write a diagnostic message describing the problem, using
fortran I/O,  to an 'error stream' unit number selectable via the package's set
up routine.<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>Note that if the package starts at the unix script, rather than
Fortran, level making a graceful exit includes returning control to the
package's script level by using a STOP statement in the Fortran part of the
package.<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>3.7</b> The package should be written so that it is as resolution
independent as possible. The resolution must be adjustable via the set up
routine for the package.<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>3.8</b>  Precompilers: these are used, for example,  to provide a
means of selecting (or deselecting) parts of the code for compilation. Clearly
to simplify portability of code we need to all use the same precompiler, and
this needs to be available to every centre. The  C precompiler is probably the
best option since it will be found on all machines using the unix operating
system.<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><i>Adopting this as the standard precompiler will have some problems
as different centres are currently committed to different precompilers.
However, it may not be too big a task for each centre to convert from their
current precompiler to the C precompiler. </i><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>3.9</b>  All unix scripts must be written using the posix shell.
This is a standardised shell, available on all POSIX compliant unix systems,
with many useful features.<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>3.10 </b>Each program unit should be stored in a separate
file.<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>4.0 Guidance For The Use Of Dynamic Memory</b><p>
<b></b>The use of dynamic memory is highly desirable as, in principle, it
allows one set of compiled code to work for any specified resolution (or at
least up to hardware memory limits); and allows the efficient reuse of work
space memory. Care must be taken, however, as there is potential for
inefficient memory usage, particularly in parallelized code. For example heap
fragmentation can occur if space is allocated by a lower level routine and then
not freed before control is passed back up the calling tree. There are three
ways of obtaining dynamic memory in Fortran 90:<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>a) Automatic arrays: These are arrays initially declared within a
subprogram whose extents depend upon  variables known at runtime e.g. variables
passed into the subprogram via its argument list.<p>
<p>
b) Pointer arrays: Array variables declared with the POINTER attribute may be
allocated space at run time by using the ALLOCATE command. <p>
<p>
c) Allocatable arrays: Array variables declared with the ALLOCATABLE attribute
may be allocated space at run time by using the ALLOCATE command. However,
unlike pointers, allocatables are not allowed inside derived data types.<p>
<p>
<b>4.1</b> Use automatic arrays in preference to the other forms of dynamic
memory allocation.<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>4.2 </b>Space allocated using b) and c) above must be explicitly
freed using the DEALLOCATE statement.<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>4.3</b> In a given program unit do not repeatedly ALLOCATE space,
DEALLOCATE it and then ALLOCATE a larger block of space. This will almost
certainly generate large amounts of  unusable memory.<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>4.4</b> Always test the sucess of a dynamic memory allocation and
deallocation. The ALLOCATE and DEALLOCATE statements have an optional argument
to let you do this.<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>5.0 Coding Rules For Routines</b><p>
<b></b>By routines we mean any fortran program unit such as a subroutine,
function, module or program. These rules are designed to encourage good
structured programming practice, to simplify maintenance tasks, and to ease
readability of exchanged code by establishing some basic common style rules.<p>
<p>
<b>5.1 Banned Fortran Features</b><p>
<b></b>Some of the following sections detail features deprecated in or made
redundant by Fortran 90. Others ban features whose use is deemed to be bad
programming practice as they can degrade the maintainability of code.<p>
<p>
<b>5.1.1</b> COMMON blocks - use MODULEs instead.<p>
<p>
<b>5.1.2</b> EQUIVALENCE  - use POINTERs or derived data types instead.<p>
<p>
<b>5.1.3</b> Assigned and computed GO TOs - use the CASE construct instead.<p>
<p>
<b>5.1.4</b> Arithmetic IF statements - use the block IF construct instead.<p>
<p>
<b>5.1.5</b> Labels (one recommended use: see 3.5.4).<p>
<p>
<b>5.1.5.1</b> Labelled DO constructs - use END DO instead.<p>
<p>
<b>5.1.5.2</b> I/O routine's END = and ERR = use IOSTAT instead.<p>
<p>
<b>5.1.5.3</b> FORMAT statements: use CHARACTER parameters or explicit format
specifiers  inside the READ or WRITE statement instead.<p>
<p>
<b>5.1.5.4</b> GO TO <p>
<b>5.1.5.4.1 </b>The only recognised use of GO TO, indeed of labels, is to jump
to the error handling section at the end of a routine on detection of an error.
The jump must be to a  CONTINUE statement and the label used must be 9999.
Evens so, it is recommended that this practice be avoided.<p>
<p>
<b>5.1.5.4.2</b> Any other use of GO TO can probably be avoided by making use
of IF, CASE, DO WHILE, EXIT or CYCLE statements. If a GO TO really has to be
used, then clearly comment it to explain what is going on and terminate the
jump on a similarly commented CONTINUE statement.<p>
<p>
<b>5.1.6</b> PAUSE<p>
<p>
<b>5.1.7</b> ENTRY statements:  - a subprogram may only have one entry point.<p>
<p>
<b>5.1.8</b> FUNCTIONs with side effects i.e. functions that alter variables in
their argument list or in modules used by the function; or one that performs
I/O operations. <i>This is very common in C programming, but can be  confusing.
Also, efficiencies can be made if the compiler knows that functions have no
side effects. High Performance Fortran, a variant of Fortran 90 designed for
massively parallel computers, will allow such instructions.</i> <p>
<p>
<b>5.1.9</b> Implicitly changing the shape of an array when passing it  into a
subroutine. Although actually forbidden in the standard it was very common
practice in FORTRAN 77 to pass 'n' dimensional arrays into a subroutine where
they would, say, be treated as a 1 dimensional array. This practice, though
banned in Fortran 90, is still possible with external routines for which no
INTERFACE block has been supplied. This only works because of assumptions made
about how the data is stored: it is therefore unlikely to work on a massively
parallel computer. Hence the practice is banned.<p>
<p>
<b>5.2 General Style Rules</b><p>
<b></b>The general ethos is to write portable code that is easily readable and
maintainable. Code should be written in as general a way as possible to allow
for unforseen modifications. In practice this means that coding will take a
little longer. This extra effort is well spent, however, as maintenance costs
will be reduced over the lifetime of the software.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>5.2.1</b> Use free format syntax.<p>
<p>
<b>5.2.2</b> The maximum line length permitted is 80 characters. Fortran 90
allows a line length of up to 132 characters, however this could cause problems
when viewed on  older terminals, or if print outs have to be obtained on A4
paper. <p>
<p>
<b>5.2.3</b> IMPLICIT NONE must be used in all program units. This ensures that
all variables must be explicitly declared, and hence documented. It also allows
the compiler to detect typographical errors in variable names.<p>
<p>
<b>5.2.4</b> Use meaningful variable names, perferably in English.<p>
<p>
<b>5.2.5</b> Fortran statements must be written in upper case only or with
initial letter capitalization and the rest in lower case. Names, of variables,
parameters, subroutines etc may be written in mixed, mostly lower, case.<p>
<p>
<b>5.2.6</b> To improve readability indent code within DO; DO WHILE; block IF;
CASE; INTERFACE; etc constructs by 2 characters. <p>
<p>
<b>5.2.7</b> Indent continuation lines to ensure that e.g. parts of a multi
line equation line up in a readable manner.<p>
<p>
<b>5.2.8</b> Where they occur on separate lines indent type c) internal
comments to reflect the structure of the code. If this is done by one character
less than the code indentation comments are clearly separated from the code yet
do not break up its structure.<p>
<p>
<b>5.2.9</b> Use blank space, in the horizontal and vertical, to improve
readability. In particular leave blank space between variables and operators,
and try to line up related code into columns. For example,<p>
<p>
instead of:<p>
<p>
! Initialize Variables<p>
x=1<p>
MEANINGFUL_NAME=3.0<p>
SILLY_NAME=2.0<p>
<p>
write:<p>
<p>
! Initialize variables<p>
 x              = 1<p>
 MeaningfulName = 3.0<p>
 SillyName      = 2.0<p>
<p>
<p>
Similarly, try to make equations recognisable and readable as equations.
Readability is greatly enhanced by starting a continuation line with an
operator placed in an appropriate column rather than ending the continued line
with an operator.<p>
<p>
<b>5.2.10</b> Do not use tab characters in your code: this will ensure that the
code looks as intended when ported.<p>
<p>
<b>5.2.11</b> Separate the information to be output from the formatting
information on how to output it on I/O statements. That is don't put text
inside the brackets of the I/O statement.<p>
<p>
<b>5.2.12</b> Delete unused header components.<p>
<p>
<b>5.2.13</b> There was a strong desire by many of the authors of this document
to include a recommended naming convention for variables. It was decided
however that Fortran 77 convensions were unsuitable, and that more experience
of Fortran 90 was required before an appropriate convention could be specified.
It is intended that such a convention be included in a revised version of this
document.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>5.3 Use Of New Fortran Features</b><p>
<b></b>It is inevitable that there will be 'silly' ways to use the new features
introduced into Fortran 90. Clearly we may want to ban such uses and to
recommend certain practices over others. However, there will have to be a
certain amount of experimentation with the new language until we gain enough
experience to make a complete list of such recommendations. The following rules
will have to be ammended and expanded in the light of such experience.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>5.3.1</b> We recommend the use of USE, ONLY to specify which of the
variables, type definitions etcdefined in a module are to be made available to
the USEing routine.<p>
<p>
<b>5.3.2</b> Discussion of the use of Interface Blocks<p>
<b>5.3.2.0</b> Introduction<p>
Explicit interface blocks are required between f90 routines if optional or
keyword arguments are to be used. They also allow the compiler to check that
the type, shape and number of arguments specified in the CALL are the same as
those specified in the subprogram itself. In addition some compilers (e.g. the
Cray f90 compiler)  use the presence of an interface block in order to
determine if the subprogram being called is written in f90 (this alters how
array information is passed to the subroutine). Thus, in general it is
desireable to provide explicit interface blocks between f90 routines.There are
several ways to to do this, each of which has implications for program design;
code management; and even configuration control. The three main options are
discussed in the following sections:<p>
<p>
<b>5.3.2.1</b> Option I: Explicitly Coded Interface Blocks<p>
Interface blocks may be explicitly written into the calling routine,
essentially by copying the argument list declaration section from the called
routine. This direct approach has, however, some disadvantages. Firstly, it
creates an undesirable increase in the work required to maintain the calling
routine, as if the argument list of the called routine changes the INTERFACE
block must be updated as well as the CALL. Further, there is no gaurantee that
the INTERFACE block in the calling routine is actually uptodate and the same as
the actual interface to the called routine.<p>
<p>
<b>5.3.2.2</b> Option II: Explicitly Coded Interface Blocks in a Module<p>
Interface blocks for all routines in a package may be explicitly written into a
module, and this module used by all routines in the package. This has the
advantage of having one routine to examine to find the interface specification
for all routines - which may be easier than individually examining  the source
code for all called routines. However, an INTERFACE block must still be
maintained in addition to the routine itself and CALLs to it, though a program
or e.g. a unix script could be written to automatically generate the module
containinng the interface blocks.<p>
<p>
<b>5.3.2.2</b> Option III: Automatic Interface Blocks<p>
Fortran 90 compilers can automatically provide explicit interface blocks
between routines following a CONTAINS statement. The interface blocks are also
supplied to any routine USEing the module. Thus, it is possible to design a
system where no INTERFACE blocks are actually coded and yet explicit interface
blocks are provided between all routines by the compiler. One way to do this
would be to 'modularise' the code at the f90 module level, i.e. to place
related code together in one module after the CONTAINS statement. Routine a, in
module A calling routine b in module B would then only have to USE module B to
be automatically provided with an explicit interface to routine b. Obviously if
routine b was in module a instead then no USE would be required. One
consequence of this approach is that a module and all the routines contained
within it make up a single compilation unit. This may be a disadvantage if
modules are large or if each module in a package contains routines which USE
many other modules within the package (in which case changing one routine in
one module would necessitate the recompilation of virtually the entire
package). On the other hand the number of compilation units is greatly reduced,
simplifying the compilation and configuration control systems.<p>
<p>
<b>5.3.2.4</b> Conclusion<p>
Options II) and III) above both provide workable solutions to the problem of
explicit interface blocks. Option III is probably preferable as the compiler
does the work of providing the interface blocks, reducing programming
overheads,  and at the same time gauranteeing that the interface blocks used
are correct. Which ever option is chosen will have significcant impact on code
management and configuration control as well as program design.<p>
<p>
<b>5.3.3</b> Array notation should be used whenever possible. This should help
optimization and will reduce the number of lines of code required. To improve
readability show the array's shape in brackets, e.g.:<p>
<p>
	1dArrayA(:) 	= 1dArrayB(:) + 1dArrayC(:)<p>
	2dArray(:, :)	= scalar * Another2dArray(:, :)<p>
<p>
<b>5.3.4</b> Always name 'program units' and always use  the END PROGRAM; END
SUBROUTINE; END INTERFACE; END MODULE; etc constructs, again specifying the
name of the 'program unit'. <p>
<p>
<b>5.3.5</b> Use &gt;, &gt;=, ==, &lt;, &lt;=, /= instead of .gt., .ge., .eq.,
.lt., .le., .ne. in logical comparisons. The new syntax, being closer to
standard mathematical notation, should be clearer.<p>
<p>
<b>5.3.6</b> Don't put multiple statements on one line: this will reduce code
readability. <p>
<p>
<b>5.3.7</b> Variable declarations: it would improve understandability if we
all adopt the same conventions for declaring variables as Fortran 90 offers
many different syntaxes to acheive the same result.<p>
<p>
<b>5.3.7.1</b> Don't use the DIMENSION statement or attribute: declare the
shape and size of arrays inside brackets after the variable name on the
declaration statement.<p>
<p>
<b>5.3.7.2</b> Always use the :: notation, even if their are no attributes.<p>
<p>
<b>5.3.7.3</b> Declare the  length of a character variable using the (len = )
syntax.<p>
<p>
<b>5.3.8</b>  We may want to ban the use of recursive routines on efficiency
grounds (they tend to be inefficient in their use of cpu and memory). <i>The
use of operator overloads may also have efficiency implications.</i><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>6.0 Enforcing These Standards</b><p>
<b></b>It is obviously important to ensure that these standards are adhered to
- particularly that the documentation is kept up to date with the software; and
that the software is written in as portable a manner as possible. If these
standards are not adhered to exchangeability of the code will suffer. It may be
that software tools, such as QA fortran, could be tailored to test for
compliancy to these standards. This needs investigation.<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><i>One option would be to set up a central database for exchangeable
code and its external documentation. The acceptance criteria would be that the
standards set out in this document are met. This would of course require
funding to provide hardware, software and personnel to maintain the data
base... </i><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><i>At the other extreme each centre could adopt it's own enforcement
strategy, and distribute lists of it's own exchangeable software to the other
centres...</i><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><i>The best solution may well be to design a distributed system making
use of Mosaic and internet. </i><tt></tt><p>
