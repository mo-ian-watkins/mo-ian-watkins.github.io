<H2>The Met. Office Charter Standard for the Public 1995/96</H2>

<P>
We aim to serve the public by providing the following services:
<H3>Up-to-date weather information and forecasts</H3>

<P>
We will provide weather information and forecasts through radio
and television, newspapers, telephone and facsimile services.
<P>
Our performance standards for forecast accuracy and customer satisfaction
in 1995/96 are to attain an accuracy of 84% for the 24-hour national
forecasts broadcast at 1755 by BBC Radio 4 and to attain a satisfaction
score of at least 80% for the general public forecasts on BBC
Television and Radio 4.
<P>
Our achievements in 1994/95 were:
<UL>
<LI>a forecast accuracy of 85%,
<LI>a satisfaction score of 81%.
</UL>

<H3>Weather warnings</H3>

<P>
We will issue warnings of severe weather through radio and television,
to emergency organisations such as the police and fire services.

<P>
We will also provide warnings of adverse road conditions to the
police, to local and national radio.
<P>
Our performance standard for these warning services is based on
the satisfaction expressed by members of emergency organizations.
This is measured in a survey conducted each year. In 1995/96 the
standard is to attain a satisfaction score of at least 80%.
<P>
Our achievement in 1994 was 79%.
<P>
We will provide gale warnings and marine forecasts for radio.
<P>
Our performance standards for these marine services are based
on targets set for the accuracy of gale warnings. In 1995/96 these
are to attain a success rate of at least 81% with no more than
18% of false alarms for gale warnings issued 6-12 hours ahead
for shipping.
<P>
Our achievements in 1994/95 were:
<UL>
<LI>a success rate of 85%,
<LI>a false alarm rate of 13%.
</UL>

<H3>Advice in emergencies</H3>

<P>
We will provide warnings of coastal flooding to the National Rivers
Authority and the police.
<P>
Our performance standards are agreed with the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, the government department responsible for
coastal flood protection and warning. Our targets are related
to timeliness of issue, identification of major surges and the
minimization of false alarms. All four targets were achieved in
the eight months ending 30 April 1994 (few significant surges
occur during the summer months). The most important target is
to issue warnings to the National Rivers Authority and police
forces concerned a minimum of 12 hours in advance of a major surge.
There were two in the eight-month period, those of 14 November
1993 and 28 January 1994, and the target was achieved.
<P>
We will provide weather advice for the statutory authorities in
environmental pollution emergencies. These emergencies may arise,
for example, from the accidental release of toxic chemicals into
the atmosphere, and our response to them is given the highest
priority. A performance target has been introduced for 1995/96
and is to provide specialized weather information within 30 minutes
on at least 85% of occasions.
<H3>Weather and climate information</H3>

<P>
We will maintain the National Meteorological Library and Archive
at Bracknell which you may visit free of charge, and develop low-cost
publications containing basic weather and climate information
for schools and the general public.
<P>
We measure our performance by the high demand for our educational
services. During 1994 over 7,000 enquiries were answered by our
education section.
<HR>

<H3>Measuring how we are doing</H3>

<H3>Monitoring our forecasts</H3>
<P>
We continually monitor our performance. For instance we compare
the forecast with what is observed and measure its accuracy. Forecasts
have been steadily improving over the years and this is reflected
in the performance targets set for our forecasts on radio and
television and for our gale warnings.
<H3>Public surveys</H3>

<P>
We use independent consultants to make regular surveys. We welcome
your comments and will react positively to them. Satisfaction
scores are calculated using a scale of 1 (very dissatisfied) to
5 (very satisfied). The average value, scaled to lie between 0
and 100, is the percentage satisfaction score.
<H3>Performance targets</H3>

<P>
We have a number of performance targets in addition to those set
out here. We review our targets each year and set standards for
quality of service, accuracy and increases in efficiency. Further
information on these targets, and our performance against them,
may be found in our Annual Report and Accounts.
<H3>Finding out more</H3>

<P>
You can contact your nearest weather centre, or the Enquiries
Office at Bracknell.
<P>
We will be pleased to answer any questions you may have on our
services, and you can ask for a brochure describing them and The
Met. Office. You can also find out about our services from programme
magazines, newspapers, and in telephone directories under 'weather'.
We want to hear your views and learn if you are satisfied with
our services.
<P>
<B>Should you have a complaint, </B>please telephone the Enquiries
Office or, better still, write in. We aim to respond to a complaint
within five working days of its receipt, or at least provide you
with an acknowledgment and an estimate of when a full reply may
be expected.
