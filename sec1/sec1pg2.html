<H2>A brief history of The Met. Office</H2>
<P>
The Met. Office, formal title, The Meteorological Office, was
formed as a small department within the Board of Trade in 1854,
under the command of Admiral FitzRoy, to provide meteorological
and sea current information to mariners. By 1861, a sufficient
number of regular observations were being received by telegraph
from Great Britain and France to permit the issue of storm
warnings to ports and forecasts to the press. These services were
stopped in 1866 on the recommendation of a Royal Society
committee. Storm warnings were rapidly reinstated but published
forecasts did not reappear until 1879.
<P>
About this time, the first international meteorological congress
in Vienna established an International Meteorological
Organization to further essential international co-operation. 
This eventually transformed into the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO), a specialized agency of the United Nations.
<P>
Rapid developments both within and without meteorology led to the
establishment of the first outstation at South Farnborough in
1912 to give advice to pilots.  During the Great War,
meteorological services were developed in the separate parts of
the armed forces but in 1920, all four were combined into one
organization under the auspices of the Air Ministry, a step which
has been of enormous benefit ever since. Services rapidly grew
and spread through the Empire.
<P>
Forecasts were first broadcast by the BBC in 1922 and captions
were shown on TV in 1936. In 1937, the Admiralty took over the
weather service for the Navy. As well as the start of World War
II, 1939 saw the introduction of a system for obtaining data from
the upper air by 'radiosonde', balloon-borne sensors transmitting
pressure, temperature and humidity data to receiving sites on
land.  There was a huge increase of staff during this era,
numbers rising to 6900. The Meteorological Research Flight was
formed in 1942 and has performed valuable work ever since,
providing detailed measurements of a wide range of atmospheric
parameters from aircraft.
<P>
After the war, a Directorate of Research was formed to control
and direct the practical and theoretical investigations that were
being carried out. The first live TV weather forecasts started
in 1954 (presenters had five minutes in those days!) and London
Weather Centre opened in 1959.
<P>
The modern era can be said to have arrived in 1962 when an
electronic computer was installed at our new HQ in Bracknell. In
1964, the first operational cloud pictures from satellites became
available. Research and development in both these fields, much
of it carried out within the Office, have transformed the science
of meteorology and will continue to do so.
<P>
1981 saw the installation of our first supercomputer, the CDC
Cyber 205, and the introduction of our 15-level atmospheric
computer model.  The Cyber was replaced by a Cray Y-MP machine
in 1990, allowing the introduction of a new 19-level model and
improved representation of atmospheric processes.
<P>
A second Cray Y-MP was installed in 1991 to support the climate
research programme carried out at the jointly-funded (Met.
Office/DoE) Hadley Centre.  Both machines were replaced by a
single Cray C90 in May 1994 with a resultant six-fold increase
in the speed of processing.
<P>
The Met. Office became an MoD Executive Agency in April 1990. A
month later, the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and
Research was opened.  The Met. Office remains a centre of
excellence for the development of the science of meteorology and
the provision of weather-related services to a wide range of
customers. <p><hr><nobr>
