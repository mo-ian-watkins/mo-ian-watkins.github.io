<h2>The Met. Office - Aims and Objectives</h2>
The Met. Office provides weather and climate-related services
to a wide range of customers. We are well known to the public
through weather forecasts broadcast on television and radio but
also provide specialised services, such as those in support of
the Armed Forces and civil aviation, warnings of severe weather
events and advice to the Government on climate change. Weather
intelligence can also be used to advantage in business planning
and operations.

changes have been proposed.
