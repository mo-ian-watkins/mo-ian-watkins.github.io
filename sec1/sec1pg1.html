<H2>Welcome to The Met. Office on the Internet!</H2>
<P>
In the UK, everyone talks about the weather.  Moreover, everyone
is affected by the ever-changing British weather, to some extent.
And in the UK, The Met. Office, the national weather service,
is synonymous with the weather.  
<P>
As a major user of computer technology, I am delighted that The
Met. Office has a place on the Internet. Through this medium,
we have an excellent opportunity to explain and demonstrate the
science of meteorology and the way in which we apply it for the
benefit of the nation.
<P>
The Met. Office is an organization with a tremendous depth of
experience and a wide range of responsibilities.<I> </I>From research
to operational services, from agriculture to aviation, from flood
to drought, The Met. Office provides an invaluable service to
the British people.  Moreover, on the international stage, our
staff make huge contributions.
<P>
Our site is in the early stages of its development and we expect
to provide much more information over the coming months. For
us at The Met. Office, the weather is a fascinating subject. 
We think that many, many people think so too and we would like
your help in developing our site.  If there is some aspect of
meteorology that you would like to know more about, or feel that
there is something we have &quot;missed out&quot;, please let
us know.  We'll see what we can do!
<P>
In the meantime, I hope you enjoy your visit to The Met. Office
on the Internet!
<P>
