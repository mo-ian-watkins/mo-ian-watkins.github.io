<h2>Annual Report &amp; Accounts 1994/95</h2>
CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S FOREWORD<P>
This year, our fourth as an Executive Agency, saw the organisation
under review, as part of the Defence Costs Study.
   Its recommendations 
were accepted by the Ministry of Defence and The Treasury.  The 
first of the study's main conclusions was that The Met. Office 
should remain a world-class science-based organization within 
the public sector.  The second, that The Met. Office should change 
its administrative and financial framework to become a Trading 
Fund, is being implemented, with shadow Trading to start in mid-1995 
in anticipation of full Trading Fund status from 1 April 1996. 
 The first two stages in the implementation of these plans have 
been a change in the structure of our organisation - in order 
to improve the focus on our wide range of customers, as set out 
in our Framework Document - and the adoption of the commercial 
accounting system used by our sister agency, the Defence Evaluation 
and Research Agency. 
<P> 
Against this background of change, The Met. Office has achieved 
some outstanding results during 1994/95.  The most notable of 
these is the significant improvement we have made in the accuracy 
of UK and world wide forecasts from our numerical prediction model, 
resulting particularly from the close collaboration between our 
research and Central Forecasting teams.  This, combined with recent 
progress in climate research, also produced marked improvements 
in climate simulation and prediction.  While improvements in our 
day-to-day forecasting accuracy underpin much of our operational 
work, those associated with climate research further enhanced 
the scientific basis for the UK Government's presentation at the 
First Conference of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention 
on Climate Change held in Berlin in April 1995.  We are also proud 
and pleased that Dr Paul Mason, our Chief Scientist, was elected 
to become a Fellow of the Royal Society. 
<P> 
Under its Director, Bernard Herdan, who has now left us to become 
Chief Executive of his own Agency, our Commercial Services (CS) 
Division had another excellent year, achieving 8% revenue growth 
and making a highly valued &#163;3.1m contribution to our core 
costs and general overheads.  This result was achieved in the 
face of vigorous competition from the private sector.  However, 
it is significant that some 44% of our CS revenue came through 
joint ventures with the private sector.  The result confirms that 
the activities of our CS Division are definitely not subsidised 
by the Defence vote. The services provided to the UK and UN Defence 
forces have been further developed, with specialized numerical 
forecasts and tactical forecasting advice provided by our staff 
working alongside the Servicemen on location around the world. 
<P> 
We have met four of the six key Business Plan targets, narrowly 
missing the other two.  We met the essential cash-limit key target 
by delivering our agreed programme of activities within budget. 
This was achieved partly through the introduction of efficiency 
measures in most Departments and partly through the successful 
introduction of a programme of voluntary early retirement.  This 
latter initiative has allowed us to reduce overall staff numbers 
by 151 over the year, yielding considerable cost-savings, equivalent 
to some &#163;4m in a full year. 
<P> 
Work has continued to develop a new pay scheme based on the value 
of individual jobs and a reduction in the number of staff grades. 
 While progress has been slower than originally planned, the new 
scheme is expected to be in operation from 1 November 1995. There 
have also been productive negotiations about increases in pay, 
and about certain reductions in the number and value of pay-related 
allowances.  After some hard bargaining, and goodwill from all 
parties, agreement was reached.  We expect the same robust but 
realistic relations to continue as we progress to Trading Fund. 
<P> 
From its inception in 1854, The Met. Office has made a vital contribution 
to the safety of the nation - the theme of the World Meteorological 
Day on 23 March 1995.  In more recent years, the economic benefits 
of meteorological services have also become increasingly valued 
here and throughout the whole world.  These economic benefits 
were highlighted at a World Meteorological Organization (WMO) 
conference held in Geneva in September 1994 - just one of the 
many WMO programmes to which our staff made significant contributions. 
 Other contributions have included the work on new methods and 
protocols for international warnings of meteorological and other 
natural disasters, and on a new co-ordination framework for the 
Inter-Agency World Climate Programme. 
<P> 
Our international focus is not just confined to WMO.  Every year, 
more of our operational and research projects depend on collaboration 
with international partners.  In the last year,  collaboration 
with other European National Meteorological Services culminated 
in the approval in principle by the European Commission of the 
ECOMET scheme for a concerted approach to the provision of service, 
data and products in Europe.  We also made progress in forming 
EUMETNET,  a co-ordination framework for optional programmes designed 
to improve and to economize on the European-wide meteorological 
infrastructure.  In the forum of the International Civil Aviation 
Organization (ICAO), Met. Office staff were heavily involved with 
the organization and implementation of the SADIS (Satellite Distribution 
System) programme, particularly in Africa. 
<P> 
The speed and number of the changes we have faced during 1994/95 
have made this a difficult year for all of us.  Further changes 
and challenges are inevitable as we make the transition to Trading 
Fund.  I am delighted at the progress we have already made and 
I am grateful to my staff for their loyalty and commitment; I 
am confident that they will rise to the challenges of new technical 
and financial responsibilities.  I also feel sure that they will 
participate fully in developing the new organization and will 
press on with the exciting advances we are making in all aspects 
of meteorology 
<P>
