<h2>International</h2>
The Met.Office's international services vary from forecasts for overseas
television companies to training potential forecasters for other National Met.
Services.
<p>
The majority of services offered by The Met.Office in the UK are also available
for overseas sites. Thus we provide forecasts to Formula 1 Grand Prix teams as
they travel around the world and to coffee growers in Brazil.
<p>
Developing countries may not have the infrastructure of observers and
<b><a href="../sec4pg3.html">Weather Centres</a></b> that we have 
in the UK but we welcome the opportunity to
collaborate and co-operate in setting up and establishing the necessary
computer and communication systems for running an effective meteorological
service.
