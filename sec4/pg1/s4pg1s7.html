<h2>Environment</h2>
The Met.Office is a world leader in the modelling of the atmosphere. These
models can be used by Local Authorities, Industrial Plants and many other
organisations to predict both short and long range dispersions of atmospheric
pollutants. Thus ensuring the most effective measures are taken. The pollutants
monitored can include noise, chemicals, gases etc.
<p>
Individual studies are undertaken by our <b><a href="s4pg1s5.html">consultancy</a></b> branch
<b><a href="s4pg1s5.html">Metstar</a>.</b>
<p>
Through its <b><a href="../morecs/morecs.html">MORECS</a> </b>data base The Met.Office can offer information
on soil moisture content and thus offer a service to landfill operators which
saves  time and money in day to day operations.
<p>
Long term effects on the climate due to the activities of man are studied by
<b><a href="../../sec5/sec5pg1.html">The Hadley Centre</a> </b>part of The Met.Office 
which is funded by the 
<b><a href="http://www.open.govt.uk/doe/doeindex.html">Department of the Environment</a>.</b>
<p>
Through the Public Met. Service, The Met.Office provides
emergency services to the police and the<b> Atomic Energy Authority. </b>Thus
in the case of a chemical spillage The Met.Office through its Chemet
service will provide the local police with the necessary information for
public warnings and evacuations.
