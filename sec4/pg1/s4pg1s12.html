<h2>The Weather Initiative</h2>
The Weather Initiative (TWI) is a business unit in The Met.Office dedicated to
serving the interests of manufacturing and retailing in the UK and overseas.<p>
Using some of the most advanced forecasting techniques in the world, the aim is
to help businesses become more profitable by relating company performance to
weather data and geography.
<p>
This process of <b>Weather Sensitivity Analysis </b>enables our customers, such
as supermarkets and motor component manufacturers, improve their stock control,
planning of manpower and production, raw material sourcing and many other
critical business processes. The end result is increased profitability.
