<h2>External Use Of The Unified Model</h2>
<hr>
<p>
<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>
The atmosphere and ocean modelling code used by the
Meteorological Office is freely available for use by other
research groups and meteorological centres. The code exists
within a single software system known as the Unified Model and
covers both data assimilation and prediction for global or
regional domains. It is the code used by the Meteorological
Office in carrying out its operational numerical weather
forecasting activities. It is also used by the Hadley Centre
for Climate Prediction and Research.
<p>
<h3>2. Unified Model Software</h3>
<p>
The code is written in FORTRAN 77 and ANSI C and runs under
the Bourne shell of the UNIX operating system. The Unified
Model is normally run on a Cray C90 computer and the code is
designed to use the automatic multitasking and vectorization
facilities available on Cray computers. A workstation version
of the code is also available. This runs on computer systems
using the IEEE standard for representing floating point
numbers. 
<p>
The dynamics routines and physical parametrizations are
written in the plug-compatible form agreed for the
international exchange of meteorological subroutines.
<p>
The main model components are:
<ul>
<p><li><b>User Interface</b>
<p>An X-Windows application for setting
up model integrations. It comprises
over 200 separate windows and may
be customised by the user.

<p><li><b>Reconfiguration</b>
     <p>A generalised interpolation package
     used to convert model data files to
     new resolutions and areas.

<p><li><b>Data Assimilation</b>
     <p>Analysis correction scheme using
     repeated insertion of observations.

<p><li><b>Atmosphere Model</b>
     <p>Grid point split-explicit dynamics and
     physical parametrizations.

<p><li><b>Ocean Model</b>
     <p>Based on the code of Bryan and Cox
     developed at GFDL.

<p><li><b>Atmosphere-Ocean Coupling</b>
     <p>Software to run atmosphere and ocean
     models in coupled mode, including a
     dynamic sea-ice model.

<p><li><b>Diagnostics and Output</b>
<p> Internal model package to output a
     range of diagnosed and derived
     quantities over arbitrary time periods,
     sub-areas and levels.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>3. Access and Availability</h3>
<p>
New releases of the model are made available once they have
been accepted by internal users. The data and software are
available on tape in the following formats:

<ul>
<li> QIC 150 format on a DL6150 or DL6250 1/4" cartridge
<li> DDS format on a 60m or 90m DAT cartridge.
</ul>
<p>
Both the Cray compatible and workstation versions of the
code are available and include the following features:

<ul>
<li>Conversion software to pass output to workstations (Cray
version only).
<li>On-line documentation covering both technical and
scientific aspects of the model in Wordperfect 6.0 and
Postscript formats. A Mosaic based hypertext browser is also
available linking source code viewing and documentation.
<li> A small archive of model analyses
and all ancillary files needed to run the
system.
<li>A facility to run the atmosphere model from ECMWF GRIB
coded data.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>4. Future Developments</h3>
<p>
It is planned to provide information on software
upgrades via an Internet WWW server connected to the Meteorological
Office. This service will be introduced during 1995.
<p>
A message passing version of the code is under development
using PVM and MPI. This will allow the code to be run on distributed
memory parallel computer systems or on networks of
workstations. The messaging passing version of the atmosphere
component will be available in the second half of 1995.
<p>
<h3>5. Contacts</h3>
<p>
Two full time members of staff support external use of the
model. They provide initial help and advice on installation
procedures. If you have an agreed joint research project with
the Meteorological Office, you may qualify for further free
support. Support may also be available on a repayment basis. 
<p>
Please note that a small fee will be charged to cover administration costs.
