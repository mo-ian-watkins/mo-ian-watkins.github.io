<H2>About the Hadley Centre</H2>
The Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research is jointly
funded by the United Kingdom Department of the Environment
and the United Kingdom Meteorological Office. The main objective of the Centre is
to provide, for the UK Government, an authoritative, up-to-date assessment of
both natural and man-made climate change. The main aspects of the research
programme are:     

<UL>
<LI>To  simulate the present climate and understand its natural variability.<BR><BR>
<LI>To  understand the factors controlling climate change and to predict
    global and regional climate change up to the end of the 21st century.<BR><BR>
<LI>To  develop and use global climate models to support the above tasks.<BR><BR>   
<LI>To provide a focus for both national research programmes relevant
    to climate change prediction and for interaction with international
    programmes; to facilitate the incorporation of results from these
    programmes into the prediction models. 
</UL>
<p>
The Hadley Centre was opened in the spring of 1990 and there are now approximately
100 scientists and support staff working at the Centre. There are also facilities
for a number of visiting scientists to work on problems of mutual interest.
