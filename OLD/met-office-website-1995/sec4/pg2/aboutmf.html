<h2>About MetFAX</h2> 
 
MetFAX is the premium rate dial-up fax weather service operated 
by the Met Office since 1991 which allows any fax machine and 
most fax software to receive a variety of weather services by 
simply dialling one of the MetFAX product fax numbers. The service 
operates on the principle of POLL RECEIVE whereby a fax machine 
can call another fax machine and request a document which is stored 
in its memory. In the case of MetFAX all the documents are stored 
in a specialised computer fax database with 90 telephone lines 
to cater for thousands of calls per day. 
<P> 
To use MetFAX from a fax machine, callers should dial the appropriate 
number from the handset of their fax machine, and press the start 
button after the fax tone. Users without a handset should follow 
the instructions for POLL RECEIVE in the fax handbook.  
<P> 
To use MetFAX from PC fax software usually requires a telephone 
in parallel with the modem. The fax software should be started 
and set to manual receive mode, then the MetFAX number dialled 
from the telephone. On hearing the fax tone the manual receive 
function should be selected, whereupon the fax software should 
take over the call and the telephone handset can be replaced. 
This technique will not work with all software, and many software 
packages fail to receive all MetFAX pages. Specific fax software 
which does work is Delrina WinFAX Pro which has inbuilt polling 
(called RETRIEVE REMOTE) and does not require a parallel telephone. 
Windows 95 has inbuilt fax retrieval software which can be found 
in the ACCESSORIES/FAX program group. 
<P>
