<h2>Marine Inshore</h2>
Knowledge of the weather forecast is vital to the safety of people
involved in the wide range of sporting and commercial activities that take place in our
inshore waters.  The Met.Office provides services both to the sports person
and to the operators of sporting and commercial facilities. These
services are also designed to help the individual maximise their enjoyment and the
operator maximise their cost effectiveness.
<p>
<dl>
The range of products include the telephone weather service <a href="../pg2/marine.html">Marinecall</a> and
the <a href="../pg2/metfaxmar.html">MetFAX Marine</a> fax service.  For more specialist advice there is a telephone consultancy service
which can be arranged on a repayment basis, tel. <b> 01703 220646</b> and <a href="../mist/mist.html">MIST</a>,
 a system which provides customers with the latest weather information on a PC.  The <a href="../../cgi-bin/Inshore.html">Inshore Waters</a>,
<a href="../../cgi-bin/Offshore.html">Offshore Waters</a> forecasts and <a href="../../cgi-bin/GaleWarn.html">Gale Warnings</a> are copied to this site.
