<h2>Aviation</h2>

The Met.Office provides services to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which
is the UK Met. Authority for Aviation, and provides tailored services to
commercial organisations world-wide. The Met.Office is one of only two World Area Forecast Centres appointed by the
International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) through the British government
and the CAA, providing global forecasts of upper winds and temperatures for all
flights throughout the world.
<p>
Under the direction of the CAA The Met.Office provides low level forecasts for
aviation over the UK and offshore waters. A basic service agreed with the CAA
provides information to enable all pilots, whether flying for pleasure or for
commercial benefits to self brief before take off.
<p>
To enable private pilots, smaller aerodromes and flying clubs to fly safely,
with confidence and to plan more economically The Met.Office provides tailored
weather information by phone, fax and PC.
