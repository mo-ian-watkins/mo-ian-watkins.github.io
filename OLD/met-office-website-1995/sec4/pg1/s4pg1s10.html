<h2>Legal</h2>
Solicitors are often faced with legal cases that involve the weather, be it
motor accidents or household damage disputes with insurance companies. The
Met.Office through its <b>Weather Evidence </b>service can provide legal
reports and expert witnesses to ensure that cases are settled as quickly and
cost effectively as possible. We also have an emergency service to ensure that
reports when urgent are received as quickly as possible. In addition there is a
telephone consultancy service which can advise whether the full report or
witness is necessary.
