<h2>The Marine Weather Group</h2>
The Marine Weather Group is a business unit within The Met.Office specialising
in offering tailored services to the offshore and marine industries. Based in
Aberdeen the unit aims to give a service that helps customers save money and
operate more efficiently.
<p>
For the offshore industry highly accurate, specialised forecasts are given on a
frequent basis with access provided to forecasters on a 24 hour basis. In this
way offshore installations are able to avoid costly damage due to bad weather
by being prepared well in advance. Additionally delicate weather sensitive
operations can be carried out when the conditions are most suitable.
<p>
For the shipping industry a shiprouteing service, <b><a href=../metroute/s4pg1mr.html>MetROUTE</a></b> is provided
on an international basis enabling voyages to be planned and routed to ensure
lowest bunkering costs and fastest times. This service is manned by master
mariners with direct experience of a ship's highest priorities.
<p>
Other services to the marine industry include specialised forecasts for fishing
fleets, ferry services and ports.
<p>
For those needing direct access to  up-to-date weather information The
Met.Office provides <b><a href="../mist/mist.html">MIST</a>,</b> a system which downloads direct to your own PC
giving animated satellite and other weather details.
