<h2>Utilities</h2>
The Met.Office provides a specialised service to utility companies providing
gas, electricity and <b><a href="s4pg1s17.html">water</a></b>. These services
are tailored to help the companies anticipate demand by region and thus to plan
production and distribution effectively and efficiently.
<p>
Each utility provider be it a national company or a small independent will have
its own individual needs with regard to weather data and forecasting services.
The superior computing power and resource of The Met.Office helps all our
customers to forecast demand and meet the needs of their users cost
effectively. For those involved in the <b><a href="s4pg1s4.html">Building and Construction </a></b>of
utility facilities further services are available.
