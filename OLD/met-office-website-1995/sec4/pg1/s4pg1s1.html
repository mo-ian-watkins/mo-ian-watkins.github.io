<h2>Agriculture</h2>
To help the agricultural community plan day to day activities, such as
harvesting and irrigation, in a cost effective manner The Met.Office offers a
range of up to date, site specific products and services.
<p>
The Met.Office together with ADAS maintains the National Agricultural Met. Unit
at Wolverhampton which provides services to the farming community. Services are
also provided directly to farmers and horticulturists through The Met.Office
network of local <b><a href="../sec4pg3.html">Weather Centres </a></b>and a service called <b>Weatherfax.</b>
<p>
Our PC weather system, <b><a href="../mist/mist.html">MIST</a> </b>,enables farmers to have current
animated weather information downloaded onto their own computer at home or
office.
<p>
Agrochemical companies and other agricultural organisations are also
provided with specific Consultancy and meteorological  data services through
the Market Sector Manager at Bracknell.
