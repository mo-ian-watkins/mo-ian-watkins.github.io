<h2>Defence</h2>
The Defence Services Branch of  The Met.Office is one the Office's largest
branches employing over 500 people: 19 in the `policy' unit in Bracknell and
the remainder at more than 50 operational RAF, Army and PE Range stations both
in the UK and abroad.
<p>
As well as providing on site forecasting services the Defence branch also
offers consultancy and research services to MOD and Defence Agency staff such
as:
<p>
<ul>
<b>Tactical Decision Aids</b> - used to predict the performance of weapon systems
and sensors because, for example, laser guided bombs, night vision goggles and
infrared sensors are all affected by the weather.
<p>
<b>Radio and Microwave Propagation</b> - The Met.Office has access to state-of-the-art
models to assist in tactical decisions in the presence of `radar ducts'
which affect radar performance.
<p>
<b>Electro-optics</b> - Further models are used to forecast night illumination levels
to support the use of night vision goggles and forward looking infrared.
<p>
<b>Acoustic Propagation</b> - Operational models have been developed to help ranges
predict the transmission of noise to local populations.
<p>
<b>Field Support</b> - Operational services are supplied to Armed Forces in the
field, in places such as Bosnia, via Mobile Meteorological Units which can
travel at very short notice to scenes of conflict complete with deployable
satellite reception systems and an Outstation Display System for presenting
all the relevant meteorological information.
