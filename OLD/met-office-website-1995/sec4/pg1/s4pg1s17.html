<h2>Water</h2>
The water industry has a challenging task to provide potable water and disposal
services to a wide variety of users throughout the UK. The Met.Office provides
services to all parts of the industry from water suppliers to sewage engineers.
In this industry the weather affects both the demand for the product and the
availability of supplies thus it is imperative that the operating companies
have an accurate site specific service tailored for their needs.
<p>
A range of services is available:
<ul>
<b><a href="../mist/mist.html">MIST</a></b> a system of providing current weather information direct to your PC.<br>
<b>Weather Sensitivity Analysis </b>a process for relating business variables to the weather.<br>
<b>Forecasts</b> available in a variety of timescales.<br>
<b><a href="../morecs/morecs.html">MORECS</a> </b>a data based system giving soil moisture content and thus the relationship between rainfall and available water.<br>
<b>Rainfall Programmes</b><br>
</ul>
