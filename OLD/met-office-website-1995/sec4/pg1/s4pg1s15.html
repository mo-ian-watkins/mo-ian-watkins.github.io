<h2>Sport</h2>
The weather affects almost every aspect of outdoor sport, and 
accurate and routine weather information can be of great benefit 
to sports stadiums and clubs whether it be for a full season or 
for major competitions. At the very worst, inclement weather can 
completely disrupt even the most prestigious sporting event, and 
over a full season the routine use of weather information will 
bring financial savings.
<p>
For those responsible for ground or pitch maintenance, the 
Met.Office can provide information on expected rainfall leading 
to more efficient water use in preparing playing surfaces, and 
a more rapid response to changing weather during play. Our 
temperature and frost forecasts enable more effective use of 
under-soil heating giving significant reductions in energy bills.
<p>
Routine weather forecasts can also be of benefit in anticipating 
attendance numbers for crowd management purposes, safety, catering etc.
<p>
For international travel, we can provide climatological information 
enabling you to anticipate likely weather conditions and plan 
accordingly, whilst nearer the time our forecast service will 
allow you to finalise your tactics and travel arrangements.
<p>
The Met Office already provides services to major tennis and 
golf tournaments, football clubs and racecourses, even Formula 
One racing teams and climbers at the top of Everest.
