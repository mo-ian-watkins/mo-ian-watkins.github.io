<h2>Building and Construction</h2>
A range of services are offered under the Sitewise heading enabling architects,
engineers and contractors to design, plan and build in a cost effective
manner.
<p>
For architects the climate of the site is important in getting design details
correct, for engineers and contractors it is important to have climate and
forecast information to enable planning and scheduling to be done
effectively.
<p>
The Met.Office provides site specific weather information for all these
applications. Each project is different and many products are tailored
individually but amongst the routine services are the following:
<p>
<ul>
<b>MetBuild Downtime Averages</b> These invaluable data give for any site the
number of days, according to the time of year, when inclement weather is
likely to affect day to day operations on a construction project.
<p>
<b>MetBuild Downtime Summaries</b> These extremely useful data give the
number of days in any month when inclement weather would have affected project
operations on a particular site.
</ul>
<p>
These products are of relevance not only to the project designers and
constructors but also to the owners and operators such as <b>
<a href="s4pg1s17.html">Water</a></b>
companies and <b><a href="s4pg1s14.html">Highway</a></b> engineers.
<p>								
There are also specialised services for those in the<b><a href="s4pg1s13.html"> marine</a></b> sector
involved in coastal construction and ship building where other factors such as
wave heights and storm tides become relevant.
<p>
