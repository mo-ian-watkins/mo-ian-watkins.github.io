<h2><b>MetROUTE</b></h2>
<i>MetROUTE is the most accurate service of its kind in the world.</i>
<p>
It is comprehensive and reliable, and it comes with all the expertise and authority of The Met. Office, our expert forecasters, and our team of experienced master mariners.
<p>
Adverse weather is more than an inconvenience. By delaying a vessel <i>en route</i>, it leads to increased fuel costs and can reduce turn-round time at the destination. If penalty clauses are invoked, a substantial loss of profit can arise. In extreme cases, cargo can be damaged and passengers and crew put at risk.
<p>
<b>MetROUTE. Precision routeing from The Met. Office.</b>
<p>
MetROUTE helps masters, charterers and owners to offer a more reliable service, more cost-effectively.<br>
Through its outstanding accuracy, in both estimates of position and forecasts of weather, this high-performance service ensures that expected vessel positions can be plotted with confidence against forecast weather, sea and ice conditions. As a result, the MetROUTE team can help masters to select a track which meets their requirements for 'least time' or 'least weather', which reduces running costs, and increases safety and consistency.<br>
As well as its operational benefits, MetROUTE helps owners and brokers to market an added-value service with a track record of on-time delivery and secure cargo handling.
<p>
<b>High technology, for speed, accuracy and safety.</b>
<p>
MetROUTE is a combination of human expertise, the most modern computerised facilities, and over 25 years of experience supporting vessels around the world.<br>
At the heart of the service is The Met. Office team of master mariners and forecasters. Their skills and understanding are allied to a specially-designed Met. Office database and the power of the Office's supercomputers.
<p>
<b>Comprehensive and sophisticated.</b>
<p>Observations from land stations, ships, sensors, aircraft and satellites are brought together and processed within the unique Met. Office 'global model', one of the most highly developed in the world. It produces detailed forecasts of winds and waves for almost a week in advance.<br>
This information enables routes to be planned more accurately. With direct access to weather reports as they come in, the MetROUTE team can also take account of sudden changes and issue warnings as necessary.
<p>
<b>The benefits of MetROUTE.</b>
<p>
MetROUTE promotes higher levels of safety and efficiency at sea.<br>
The regular forecasts during the voyage come from professional mariners who understand the responsibilities of the master. Their advice is expert and relevant - tailored to each vessel's size, performance, cargo, location and destination. The constant positional monitoring, another feature of the service, is a valuable safety factor.<br>
At the end of each voyage, the MetROUTE team produces a comprehensive performance and evaluation report which compares actual and charter speeds, actual and alternative routes, to show the savings made by using MetROUTE.
<p>
