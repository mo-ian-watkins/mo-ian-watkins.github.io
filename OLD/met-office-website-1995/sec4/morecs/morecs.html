<h2>Met. Office Rainfall and Evaporation Calculation System - MORECS</h2> 
<em>The only operational nationwide service giving assessments of 
rainfall, evaporation and soil moisture in real time.</em> 
<p> 
At the heart of the MORECS system is a complicated equation which 
calculates the soil moisture and evaporation values from 
measurements of temperature, sunshine, wind and humidity.  The 
equation also allows for local variations in soil type and the 
crops being grown on the land. 
<p> 
MORECS calculates the soil state and evaporation for both a 40 
km by 40 km grid nation-wide on a weekly operational basis and 
at individual weather recording sites for hindsight studies.  The 
operational MORECS results can be automatically faxed to 
customers or sent by post. 
 
Some examples of the uses of MORECS include: 
<p> 
<b>Water Authorities</b><ul> 
<li>Helping to predict river flow and input to river flow models. 
<li>Predicting evaporation from open reservoirs</ul> 
<p> 
<b>Environment</b><ul> 
<li>Estimating leachate from landfill sites.</ul> 
<p> 
<b>Insurance</b><ul> 
<p> 
<li>Helping in the servicing of subsidence claims</ul> 
<p> 
<b>Agriculture</b><ul> 
<li>Assessing drought stress in crops. 
<li>Ensuring chemicals are applied when the soil moisture is most 
suitable. 
<li>Balance sheet irrigation scheduling by combining evaporation 
figures with rainfall measurements. 
<li>Trafficability: single station MORECS can help assess the value 
of low ground-pressure tyres.</ul>
