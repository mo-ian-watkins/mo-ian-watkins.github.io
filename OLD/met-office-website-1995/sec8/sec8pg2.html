<h2>Web Site Information</h2> 
<p>  
This site runs from a Hewlett Packard 9000/715 workstation using NCSA HTTPd. 
Most of the pages were written within a four-week period. The site is best 
viewed using a graphical browser running at a screen resolution of 640x480 and 
256 colours or better. If graphics are not required you can also use Lynx (or similar) 
as ALT tags have been used where required. 
<P> 
Creating this site has directly and indirectly involved many in The Met.Office.  
Thanks to all the people whose words we stole, whose time we hijacked and in whose  
footsteps we trod.

<b>Felicity Bellini - Graphics</b> (doodled in her paint package)<br>  
<cite>"There are many restrictions when designing pages for the Internet; 
image size and resolution, number of graphics, colour and type... These 
pages are a compromise between the original designs and what could  
actually be written. Our site not only looks good, but is hopefully 
easy to use; the Home page should help you locate any information 
you require. The buttons and graphics were initially created in Adobe 
Illustrator and Photoshop on the Apple Macintosh. Having saved them 
as BMP files (68 dpi, 8-bit, indexed colour), they were then converted 
to GIFs on the PC using CorelDraw. The programmer then strutted his 
stuff with HTML to produce the finished article you see here."</cite> 
<p> 
<b>James Barrott - Project Manager</b> (hassled people for site content)<br> 
<cite>"To create this site I had to use guile, flattery and persuasion to 
 assemble a big heap of information about meteorology and The Met. Office. 
 This was heaved over to Felicity and Ian who knitted it into the tasteful construction in which you  
 stand."<cite>  
<p> 
<b>Ian Watkins - Technical Co-ordinator</b> (kludged together the HTML)<br> 
<cite>"The site was built with a tree structure in mind as this allowed 
the use of a toolbar at the bottom of each page. However, because this is 
hypertext, some pages are not on the tree, therefore, on these pages 
a full toolbar isn't available. I used a PC to build this site and my toolkit  
includes PFE (Programmers File Editor) and PaintShop Pro v3.11. A workstation  
was only used to test the forms and cgi-bin scripts."</cite>
