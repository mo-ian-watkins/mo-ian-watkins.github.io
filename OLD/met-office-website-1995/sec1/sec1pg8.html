<h2>The Met. Office College</h2>

The Met. Office College is based at Shinfield Park, near Reading. 
It has residential accommodation as well as high standard training 
facilities. The College is a world leader in the provision of 
meteorological training, attracting students from many parts of 
the world to its courses. Each year about 100 overseas students from 30 
different countries are trained at the College or under its auspices. 
<P> 
The primary role of the College is to provide training to Met. 
Office staff. Normally, scientific and technical staff undergo 
training at the College at least every six years. In a typical 
year there are about 50 courses for R&amp;D staff, forecasters, 
observers and others for whom a knowledge of meteorology is useful. 
In addition there are about 30 courses for technicians and computing 
staff. 
<P> 
Developments in technology and the need to satisfy the requirements 
of customers has increased the range of skills required by staff 
in The Met. Office. For example, core forecasting courses now 
put much greater emphasis on the interpretation of numerical prediction 
models and satellite imagery, and the way in which forecast information 
is communicated to customers. 
<P> 
Training requirements are forever changing. Therefore the College 
has to take the lead in identifying training needs and finding 
ways in which they can be satisfied. This has led to the continuous 
evolution of courses and the development of new training materials 
and techniques. In particular, the College is taking part in a 
major project concerned with the development of computer-aided 
learning modules for professional meteorologists within Europe. 
 
<P> 
In addition to the training given to Met. Office staff and those 
from other National Meteorological Services, the College provides 
a number of courses each year for interested amateurs.  These 
are aimed at auxiliary or climatological observers - people who 
are not employed by The Met. Office but who provide observations 
at certain times of the day or even simply at the end of each 
month. Additional specialized courses are run for groups such 
as aviators, sailors and teachers. 
<P> 
As you can see, the work of The Met. Office College covers a wide 
range, far greater than that outlined here.  If you would like
