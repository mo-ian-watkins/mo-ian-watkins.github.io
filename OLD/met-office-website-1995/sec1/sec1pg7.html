<a name="library"></a><b>Library Services</b> 
<p> 
The prime function of the library is to serve the scientific staff of The Met. Office, but its services 
are available to anyone with a genuine interest in the weather or climate.  Our collection contains over 
250,000 items covering meteorology and climatology, with limited collections on related subjects such as fluid dynamics, 
oceanography and hydrometeorology. 
<p> 
A collection of historic meteorological literature (maintained in co-operation with the Royal Meteorological 
Society) and some 30,000 slides and photographs illustrating aspects of meteorology, may be viewed. 
<p> 
A computer database of holdings is accessible from the library, or internationally from the European Space Agency Information 
Retrieval Service (ESA-IRS) - UK agents IRS-Dialtech tel. 0171 323 7951. 
<p> 
Loans can be arranged either in person, through the interlibrary loan system, or by post, fax or exceptionally by phone. A search and  
handling fee may be charged for loans.  Research may be undertaken by the library at commercial rates by arrangement, if staff are 
available. 
<p> 
<a name="archive"></a><b>Archive Services</b> 
<p> 
The Met. Office stores meteorological records under the terms of the Public Records Act.  The Technical Archive holds meteorological data 
and charts from England, Wales and British overseas bases including ships' logs.  Records from Scotland are held in Edinburgh and 
those from Northern Ireland in Belfast. 
<p> 
Holdings include:<ul> 
<li><u>Registers of meteorological observations:</u> daily records of the weather for many locations, including those from Kew from 1842 to 1980. 
<li><u>Charts:</u> the working charts from the Central Forecasting Office.
<li><u>Marine weather log books:</u> worldwide records from both merchant and some Royal Navy ships. 
<li><u>Climatological returns:</u> dating back to about 1855, these cover temperature, wind, rainfall, solar radiation, snow and sunshine for each site. 
<li><u>Autographic records:</u> Continuous records of temperature, wind, rainfall, etc, are held for varying periods on some stations. 
<li><u>Upper-air data:</u> Some data is kept from radiosonde and pilot balloon ascents. 
</ul> 
<p> 
In addition, over the last 150 years the collection has accumulated various non-technical documents, diaries, papers, pictures, etc, relating to  
meteorology and The Met. Office.  Material cannot be removed from the Archive.
