<h2>The Met. Office - Where we are</h2>
<P>
The operational centre of The Met. Office is located at Bracknell
in Berkshire, the site also of our main administrative Headquarters
and major research facilities.
<P>
We operate a network of weather observing sites around the UK,
many of which are located on airfields.  While the majority of
these are manned, we are making increasing use of automated observing
systems, especially in more remote areas.
<P>
We also operate two networks of forecasting offices, one specializing
in the provision of information to the armed forces, especially
the RAF, and the other focusing on services to industry, commerce,
including the media, and the public.  Our TV/radio weather presenters
are probably familiar to most people!
<P>
The Met. Office maintains a significant research centre at Cardington
in Bedfordshire.  Also, a joint research facility with the University
of Reading is located at Reading in Berkshire.
