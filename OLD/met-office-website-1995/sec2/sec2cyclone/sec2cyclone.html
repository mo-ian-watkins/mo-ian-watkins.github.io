<h2>Tropical Cyclone forecasting at The Met. Office</h2>

Tropical cyclones are amongst the most powerful and destructive meteorological systems on earth.
Globally, 80 to 100 develop over tropical oceans each year. Many of these make landfall and can
cause considerable damage to property and loss of life as a result of high winds and heavy rain.
<p>
Over the last decade numerical weather prediction models have become sufficiently sophisticated
to forecast the movement of tropical cyclones with a reasonable degree of accuracy. In recent
years the UK Met. Office has increased its effort in the areas of tropical cyclone forecast
improvement and verification, dissemination and international profile of products.
<p>
The UK Met. Office produces tropical cyclone forecast advisories based on its global numerical
weather prediction model forecasts for all current storms. These are sent to various other
meteorological centres for additional guidance.  However, these advisories are not included on
this site. It is the responsibility of the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centres of the
World Meteorological Organization to issue forecasts to National Meteorological Services who
then issue public warnings. Links are provided to other sites which contain official forecast
advisories for current tropical cyclones.
<p>
The pages below provide information on the performance on the UK Met. Office in predicting recent
tropical cyclone tracks and other information of interest relating to tropical cyclones.
