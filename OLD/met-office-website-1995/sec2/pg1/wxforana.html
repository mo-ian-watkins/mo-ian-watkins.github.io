<h2>Weather Forecasting: Analysis</h2>
<p> 
The Global Telecommunication System (GTS) has been set up to transfer weather observations (and forecasts) around the world. The international circuit comprises a sequence of high-speed computer-to-computer links, using communication satellites as well as land lines. The Telecommunications Centre at Met. Office Headquarters in Bracknell has the role of passing data between Washington and continental Europe via Paris and Offenbach. It also collects observations from the UK and transmits them via the GTS. A complete set of observations from the UK is available about ten minutes past the hour of observation. 
<p> 
There are two difficulties in using the observations. Firstly, the observations may be inaccurate  
(e.g. instruments may not be functioning properly or there may be transmission errors) and secondly there are some regions (e.g. over the oceans) where there are few observations. 
<p> 
The observations taken from the GTS are stored on computer and are analysed in two different ways. 
<ul> 
	<li>The observations at a specific time are plotted on a chart. These charts are then analysed by the forecasters (with the aid of satellite and radar information) in order to understand what is going on in the atmosphere. For example, lines of constant pressure (isobars) are drawn, and these help identify important weather features such as depressions, anticyclones and fronts.  Forecasters also use these charts to make short-term local forecasts.<p> 
	<li>The observations are used to define the starting conditions for a computer forecast which can go as far as about one week ahead. 
</ul>
