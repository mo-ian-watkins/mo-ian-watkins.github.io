<h2>Weather and Forecasting</h2>
<p>
This material is provided by The Met. Office Education Section, which was setup in 1989 following the introduction of Meteorology into the National Curriculum. 
There are currently one full-time and three part-time members of staff dedicated to education within The Met. Office.  Over 130
letters are answered every week and the development of new products continues.
<p>
Meteorology is an ideal cross-curriculum activity: covering science, geography, mathematics and English.  The availability of
meteorological information on the Internet greatly aids in the delivery of the Information Technology requirements of the 
curriculum.

<h2> Tropical Cyclones</h2>
Tropical cyclones are amongst the most powerful and destructive meteorological systems on earth. 
The Met.Office has been developing techniques to improve our ability to forecast the tracks and
development of these weather systems.<br>
