<b>About MetFAX</b> 
<p> 
MetFAX is the premium rate dial-up fax weather service operated by the Met Office since 1991 which 
allows any fax machine and most fax software to receive a variety of weather services by simply 
dialling one of the MetFAX product fax numbers. The service operates on the principle of POLL 
RECEIVE whereby a fax machine can call another fax machine and request a document which is stored 
in its memory. In the case of MetFAX all the documents are stored in a specialised computer fax 
database with 90 telephone lines to cater for thousands of calls per day. 
<p> 
To use MetFAX from a fax machine, callers should dial the appropriate number from the handset 
of their fax machine, and press the start button after the fax tone. Users without a handset 
should follow the instructions for POLL RECEIVE in the fax handbook.  
<p> 
To use MetFAX from PC fax software usually requires a telephone in parallel with the modem. The 
fax software should be started and set to manual receive mode, then the MetFAX number dialled 
from the telephone. On hearing the fax tone the manual receive function should be selected, 
whereupon the fax software should take over the call and the telephone handset can be replaced. 
This technique will not work with all software, and many software packages fail to receive all 
MetFAX pages. Specific fax software which does work is Delrina WinFAX Pro which has inbuilt polling 
(called RETRIEVE REMOTE) and does not require a parallel telephone. Windows 95 has inbuilt fax 
retrieval software which can be found in the ACCESSORIES/FAX program group. 
<p>
