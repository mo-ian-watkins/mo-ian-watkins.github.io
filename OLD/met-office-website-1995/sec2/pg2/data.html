<h2>Education Services Weather Data</h2>
<p> 
<b>The supply of information and data</b> 
<p> 
The Education Service receives many requests for information. We try to 
answer enquiries as soon as possible, but we cannot guarantee to handle enquiries in time if they are left to the last moment. Please contact us as soon as possible to tell us what you need so that there is time 
to match your requirements to what is available. In this way you will not be 
held up by lack of information. 
<p> 
To enable us to process enquiries as quickly as possible, it would be 
appreciated if requests for data for a class project are made by one individual 
and not, as has happened, by nearly every member of the class. 
<p> 
Note that all information and data supplied by the Education Service must only 
be used for educational purposes. Anything supplied must not be used for 
commercial purposes. 
<p> 
<b>Other source of information and data</b> 
<p> 
Most school, college or public libraries hold books and atlases dealing 
with meteorology, weather and climate, as well as many related topics. 
<p> 
Many newspapers contain weather observations from the U.K.  Also there are 
often observations from around the world. These observations can form the basis 
for many interesting projects. Do not forget that a very good source of weather 
observations are ones that students make themselves. 
<p> 
<b>Free standard items</b> 
<p> 
A range of information leaflets, brochures and basic climatological data 
sheets are available free of charge with a limit of one copy of each item per 
individual or school. However, further photocopying of the material is 
permitted. The amount of material requested should be kept to a minimum. 
<p> 
<b>Specialised or large amounts of data</b> 
<p> 
Large amounts of data or specialised data have to be prepared to order. 
Consequently they can be expensive. An estimate of the cost can be given, but 
the actual charge will be determined by the time taken to extract the data. 
<p> 
Before starting on your project your investigation ask yourself the following. 
<p><ul> 
	<li>Quantity: How much data is required? Can I handle all the data I think I 
		need? 
	<li>Use: How am I going to use the data? 
	<li>Cost: Can I use standard sets of data that are easily acquired (such as 
		the standard climatological data sheets) and minimise the amount I have to 
		pay?</ul> 
<p> 
<b>Obtaining specialised or large amounts of data</b> 
<p> 
If you decide you need the specialised data or a large amount of data, 
then remember the three <em>W's</em> when you contact us: <em>where</em>, <em>what</em> and <em>when</em>. 
<p> 
<em>Where:</em> Give the location that you require the data for - if possible 
give the name of the place, the nearest town and the National Grid Reference. 
Although we may not have the data for your chosen location, with this 
information we should be able to provide you with data from a nearby site 
approved by The Met. Office. 
<p> 
<em>What:</em> Give an accurate description of the type of data you require. For 
example if you simply ask for 'temperatures' it is not clear what you want. You 
may require hourly values or perhaps the daily maximum, minimum or mean 
temperatures. Alternatively you may want the  monthly mean values or the 
extreme values for each month. 
<p> 
<em>When:</em> Give the date or period for which the data is required. Remember 
that data for one element for one year will produce a lot of figures - 365 
daily values or 8760 hourly values for example. 
<p> 
There are currently 3 types of data sheets available from The Met.Office: 
<p><ol> 
	<li><b>Monthly data sheets</b>: 
		<p> Twelve months data (one year) is represented on one A4 sheet. 
		    The elements covered are : 
			<p><ul> 
				<li>Mean maximum and minimum 
				<li>Highest Maximum and Lowest minimum 
				<li>Rainfall total and average 
				<li>Sunshine mean and average 
				<li>Days of: snow, fog, sleet, hail, thunder, etc</ul> 
		<p> 
		<b>Charges</b> 
		<p> 
		Up to four stations for one year are free of charge OR four years of 
		data for one station. 0.50 (pounds sterling) per station per year will be charged 
		thereafter. 
	<p> 
	<li><b>Daily data sheets</b>: 
 	      <p> 30/31 days data on one A4 sheet. The elements 
		covered are: 
		<p><ul> 
				<li>Daily maximum and minimum 
				<li>Daily mean 
				<li>Grass and concrete minimum 
				<li>Daily sunshine and rainfall 
				<li>Mean wind speed 
				<li>Days of : snow, sleet, hail, thunder, fog and gale</ul> 
	<p> 
	<li><b>Hourly data sheets</b>: 
		<p> 30/31 days data on one A4 sheet. The elements 
		covered are: 
		<p><ul> 
				<li>0900 dry bulb temperature 
				<li>0900 wet bulb temperature 
				<li>0900 dew point temperature 
				<li>0900 wind speed and direction 
				<li>0900 pressure 
				<li>0900 visibility 
				<li>weather observation</ul> 
		<p> 
		<b>Charges</b> 
	<p> 
		Daily and Hourly data sheets are charged the same. Up to one year's data 
		for one station is free(either one year of daily OR hourly data Or a mixture of 
		six months data for each type). Thereafter each month per station will be 
		0.25 (pounds sterling).</ol> 
<p> 
Please note that not all weather stations report all elements. Information from 
a particular station may be incomplete due to unforseen factors, such as a 
broken thermometer. Complete sheets of information will be sent whenever 
possible, this may involve substituting one station with its near neighbour.
