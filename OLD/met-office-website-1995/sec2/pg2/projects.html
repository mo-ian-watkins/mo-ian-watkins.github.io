<h2>GCSE Project Ideas</h2>
<p> 
Weather Projects are often very worthwhile: they require a wide range of skills, they are interesting and 
perhaps most importantly they are great fun. Here are some ideas for weather projects, more ideas are contained in the  
<a href="leaflets.html">leaflet</a>  ES 17 GCSE Weather projects. 
<p> 
Projects based on the weather should teach the student something about the weather.  Using loads 
of weather statistics is only really relevant to statistics projects.  As the weather takes 
place outdoors, the projects must involve some outdoor activities wherever possible. 
Extracting information from text books is to be avoided unless outside activities are difficult. 
<p> 
<b>Using Weather Observations</b> 
<p> 
Making routine observations at a school weather station is instructional on its own, 
but once a set of measurements have been accumulated over a period of two or three  
months (the longer the better), the database can be used for a variety of projects. 
<p> 
Some project suggestions 
<p><ul> 
<li>Describe the climate of the school using as many weather elements as possible. 
<li>Investigate the relationship between wind direction and rainfall. 
<li>Relate the weather records to other measurements or observations in areas other than meteorology.</ul> 
<p> 
<b>Using Temperature Measurements</b> 
<p> 
Outside temperature measurements are easy to make using relatively cheap instruments. 
<p> 
Some project suggestions 
<p><ul> 
<li>Record the rapid changes in temperature which occur around sunrise and sunset. 
<li>Investigate the change in temperature of the air close to the ground and higher up. 
<li>Investigate the effects of buildings on air temperature by day and night. 
  Make measurements in the open and at a range of distances from a building.</ul> 
<p> 
<b>Using Weather Forecasts</b> 
<p> 
Comparing weather observations and the weather forecast can form the basis of an interesting project. 
<p> 
Weather forecasts are available from the national and local press, radio and television and also from fax  
and telephone services. Weather elements that are easily monitored are temperature, rainfall and wind speed and direction. 
<p> 
<b>Points to bear in mind when selecting projects </b> 
<p> 
There are some projects that The Met. Office cannot help with, for example detailed thunderstorm information is not held  
on our databases; the only record is the occurrence of the thunderstorm on a particular day, not its time, duration or intensity. 
The Education Service is very willing to help at the planning stage of any project to ensure that it is realistic with regard 
to the available information. 
<p> 
We have details on the construction of simple instruments, the siting of instruments and a list of manufacturers of a wide 
range in style and price of meteorological instrumentation.  For these details, please write to us at:<dl>
